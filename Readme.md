# Investment Calculator React - Daniela Serrano

Investment calculator made in React. The user can add/change the initial investment, duration, Annual investment and expected return (years) and the app will calculate the interest per year, total interest and Invested capital, showing the results in a table. I built it as a result of the React course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (Udemy).
